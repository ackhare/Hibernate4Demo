session.createQuery("FROM Employee")

An object-oriented representation of a Hibernate query.
A Query instance is obtained by calling Session.createQuery().

This interface exposes some extra functionality beyond that provided by Session.iterate() and Session.find():
a particular page of the result set may be selected by calling setMaxResults(), setFirstResult()

named query parameters may be used

the results may be returned as an instance of ScrollableResults

Named query parameters are tokens of the form :name in the query string.
A value is bound to the integer parameter :foo by calling  setParameter("foo", foo, Hibernate.INTEGER);
for example. A name may appear multiple times in the query string.  JDBC-style ? parameters are also supported.
To bind a value to a JDBC-style parameter use a set method that accepts an int positional argument (numbered from zero, contrary to JDBC).  You may not mix and match JDBC-style parameters and named parameters in the same query.  Queries are executed by calling list(), scroll() or iterate(). A query may be re-executed by subsequent invocations. Its lifespan is, however, bounded by the lifespan of the Session that created it.  Implementors are not intended to be threadsafe.
