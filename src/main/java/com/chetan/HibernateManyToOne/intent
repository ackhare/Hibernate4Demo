A many-to-one association is the most common kind of association where an Object
can be associated with multiple objects.
For example a same address object can be associated with multiple employee objects.
Define RDBMS Tables:

Consider a situation where we need to store our employee records in EMPLOYEE
table which will have following structure:

create table EMPLOYEE (
   id INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
   first_name VARCHAR(20) default NULL,
   last_name  VARCHAR(20) default NULL,
   salary     INT  default NULL,
   address    INT NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

Further, many employee can have same address,
so this association can be presented using many-to-one association.
 We will store address related information in a separate table which has following structure:

create table ADDRESS (
   id INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
   street_name VARCHAR(40) default NULL,
   city_name VARCHAR(40) default NULL,
   state_name VARCHAR(40) default NULL,
   zipcode VARCHAR(10) default NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

Create both the RBDMS tables and keep them ready for the next implementation.
