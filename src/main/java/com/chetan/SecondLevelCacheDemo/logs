The diskStore path for this CacheManager will be set to /tmp/ehcache/ehcache_auto_created6081027745821319717diskstore.
To avoid this warning consider using the CacheManager factory methods to create a singleton CacheManager or specifying a separate ehcache configuration (ehcache.xml) for each CacheManager instance.
