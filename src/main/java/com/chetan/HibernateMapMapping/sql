Define RDBMS Tables:

Consider a situation where we need to store our employee records in
EMPLOYEE table which will have following structure:

create table EMPLOYEE (
   id INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
   first_name VARCHAR(20) default NULL,
   last_name  VARCHAR(20) default NULL,
   salary     INT  default NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

Further, assume each employee can have one or more certificate associated
with him/her. We will store certificate related information in a
separate table which has following structure:

create table CERTIFICATE (
   id INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
   certificate_type VARCHAR(40) default NULL,
   certificate_name VARCHAR(30) default NULL,
   employee_id INT default NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

There will be one-to-many relationship between EMPLOYEE and CERTIFICATE objects.
