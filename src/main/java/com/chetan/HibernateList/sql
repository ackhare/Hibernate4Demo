Define RDBMS Tables:

Consider a situation where we need to store our employee records in EMPLOYEE table which will have
 following structure:

create table EMPLOYEE (
   id INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
   first_name VARCHAR(20) default NULL,
   last_name  VARCHAR(20) default NULL,
   salary     INT  default NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

Further, assume each employee can have one or more certificate associated with him/her.

 A List collection mapping needs an index column in the collection table.

  The index column defines the position of the element in the collection.

  So we will store certificate related information in a separate table which has following structure:

create table CERTIFICATE (
   id INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
   certificate_name VARCHAR(30) default NULL,
   idx INT default NULL,
   employee_id INT default NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

There will be one-to-many relationship between EMPLOYEE and CERTIFICATE objects.
