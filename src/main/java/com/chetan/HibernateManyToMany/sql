create database testmanytomany;


create table EMPLOYEE (
   id INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
   first_name VARCHAR(20) default NULL,
   last_name  VARCHAR(20) default NULL,
   salary     INT  default NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

Further, assume each employee can have one or more certificate associated with him/her and a similar certificate can be associated with more than one employee. We will store certificate related information in a separate table which has following structure:

create table CERTIFICATE (
   id INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
   certificate_name VARCHAR(30) default NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

Now to implement many-to-many relationship between EMPLOYEE and CERTIFICATE objects, we would have to introduce one more intermediate table having Employee ID and Certificate ID as follows:

create table EMP_CERT (
   employee_id INT NOT NULL,
   certificate_id INT NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (employee_id,certificate_id)
);
