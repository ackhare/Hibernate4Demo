A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is a Java object that doesn't extend or
 implement some specialized classes and interfaces respectively required by the EJB framework.
 All normal Java objects are POJO.

When you design a class to be persisted by Hibernate,
 it's important to provide JavaBeans compliant code as well as one
  attribute which would work as index like id attribute in the Employee class.
